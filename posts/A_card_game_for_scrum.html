<p>Sometimes life as a Scrum Master can be difficult. An advice can be easily interpreted to an order or even an uncontructive word. So I invented a card game that can help team members to sit and enjoy a good time together with a fun card game which they can learn more about Scrum without any real life pain.</p>
<h3>Rules:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Player who can burn all <strong>Story Cards</strong> at the end of the sprint is the winner.</li>
<li>One sprint should be 7 or 14 turns. So each turn will represent a day in a sprint.</li>
<li>If two or more players can burn all cards at the end of the sprint then one who can burn more <strong>Business Point</strong> is the winner.</li>
<li>If players can not burn all cards then a player who can burn the most <strong>Business Point</strong> is the winner.  </li>
<li>All players have to draw at least 5 <strong>Story Cards</strong> randomly at their first turn (Sprint Planning Turn). Number of cards can be added depends on player's decision.</li>
<li>Each <strong>Story Card</strong> has a predefined set of <strong>Business Point</strong> and <strong>Story Point</strong>.</li>
<li>Player will earn 5 <strong>Burn down Point</strong> for every single turn except the first turn. They can use <strong>Burn down Point</strong> to burn <strong>Story Cards</strong> or use it to buy an <strong>Action Card</strong>.</li>
<li>Player can use their <strong>Burn down Point</strong> to draw an <strong>Action Card</strong> at the start of each turn. <strong>Action Card</strong> can prevent a bad effect from a <strong>Scenario Card</strong>. Buying an <strong>Action Card</strong> after drawing a <strong>Scenario Card</strong> is not allowed.</li>
<li>Each turn player have to draw a <strong>Scenario Card</strong>. This kind of card effect their <strong>Story Point</strong> and may require player to draw another card.</li>
<li>Each turn players have to select their working <strong>Story Card</strong>. Some <strong>Scenario Card</strong> will effect only working <strong>Story Card</strong>. If no <strong>Story Card</strong> selected an effect from <strong>Scenario Card</strong> would be void and they can not burn any <strong>Story Point</strong> in that turn.</li>
<li>Players have to perform a <strong>Mid Sprint Turn</strong> at the 4th turn of seven days sprint or the 7th turn of fourteen days sprint. In this turn their <strong>Burn down Point</strong> will be reduced by 2. Players can return any number of <strong>Story Card</strong> in this turn. Returned story won't give any <strong>Business Point</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Multi Sprints game</h4>
<ol>
<li>Rules for multi sprints are exactly the same with single sprint game except the score calculation will be performed at the end of the last sprint.</li>
<li>Unfinished card have to be added to the next sprint's backlog with all remaining <strong>Story Point</strong></li>
<li>Unused <strong>Action Card</strong> also remain in the next sprint.</li>
<li>For a players who has closed all <strong>Story Card</strong> in the current sprint and still have some turns left. In this case players has an option to use their point to buy an <strong>Action Card</strong> each turn to prepare for the next sprint. They also has an option to draw or not draw a <strong>Scenario Card</strong> each turn as well.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Card's Description</h3>
<h4>Story Card</h4>
<p>A story card represent User's Story in real scrum process. It's consist of predefined <strong>Business Point</strong> and <strong>Story Point</strong>. Players can not choose their story cards but they're free to accept any number of cards in each <strong>Sprint Planning Turn</strong> and they can return any number of cards at the <strong>Mid Sprint Turn</strong>.</p>
<h4>Scenario Card</h4>
<p>A scenario card represent a real situation in software development process. Some are good, more are bad. Each card may has good and bad effect to the <strong>Burn down Point</strong>. Some card may require player to draw another <strong>Story Card</strong> or <strong>Scenario Card</strong>. Same like a surprise feature that can either introduce new bugs, require more work or adding more business value at the same time.</p>
<h4>Action Card</h4>
<p>Action card represent an effort of a team member who try to make his/her every day job smoother and easier. Action card can prevent or reduce a bad effect of a <strong>Scenario Card</strong>. Some can also boots your <strong>Burn down Point</strong> which will last long to the end of the game.</p>
