<p>Sometimes life as a Scrum Master can be difficult. An advice can be easily interpreted to an order or even an uncontructive word. So I invented a card game that can help team members to sit and enjoy a good time together with a fun card game which they can learn more about Scrum without any real life pain.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Rules:</h2>
<h3>Single Sprint game.</h3>
<ol>
<li>Player who can burn all <em>Story Cards</em> at the end of the sprint is the winner.</li>
<li>One sprint should be 7 or 14 turns. So each turn will represent a day in a sprint.</li>
<li>If two or more players can burn all cards at the end of the sprint then one who can burn more <em>Business Point</em> is the winner.</li>
<li>If players can not burn all cards then a player who can burn the most <em>Business Point</em> is the winner.  </li>
<li>All players have to draw at least 5 <em>Story Cards</em> randomly at their first turn (Sprint Planning Turn). Number of cards can be added depends on player's decision.</li>
<li>Each <em>Story Card</em> has a predefined set of <em>Business Point</em> and <em>Story Point</em>.</li>
<li>Player will earn 5 <em>Burn down Point</em> for every single turn except for the first turn. They can use <em>Burn down Point</em> to burn <em>Story Cards</em> or use it to buy an <em>Action Card</em>.</li>
<li>Player can use their <em>Burn down Point</em> to draw an <em>Action Card</em> at the start of each turn. <em>Action Card</em> can prevent a bad effect from a <em>Scenario Card</em>. Buying an <em>Action Card</em> after drawing a <em>Scenario Card</em> is not allowed.</li>
<li>Each turn player have to draw a <em>Scenario Card</em>. This kind of card effect their <em>Story Point</em> and may require player to draw another card.</li>
<li>Each turn players have to select their working <em>Story Card</em>. Some <em>Scenario Card</em> will effect only working <em>Story Card</em>. If no <em>Story Card</em> selected an effect from <em>Scenario Card</em> would be void and they can not burn any <em>Story Point</em> in that turn.</li>
<li>Players have to perform a <em>Mid Sprint Turn</em> at the 4th turn of seven days sprint or the 7th turn of fourteen days sprint. In this turn their <em>Burn down Point</em> will be reduced by 2. Players can return any number of <em>Story Card</em> in this turn. Returned story won't give any <em>Business Point</em>.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Multi Sprints game</h3>
<ol>
<li>Rules for multi sprints are exactly the same with single sprint game except the score calculation will be performed at the end of the last sprint.</li>
<li>Unfinished card have to be added to the next sprint's backlog with all remaining <em>Story Point</em></li>
<li>Unused <em>Action Card</em> also remain in the next sprint.</li>
<li>For a players who has closed all <em>Story Card</em> in the current sprint and still have some turns left. In this case players has an option to use their point to buy an <em>Action Card</em> each turn to prepare for the next sprint. They also has an option to draw or not draw a <em>Scenario Card</em> each turn as well.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Card's Description</h2>
<h3>Story Card</h3>
<p>A story card represent User's Story in real scrum process. It's consist of predefined <em>Business Point</em> and <em>Story Point</em>. Players can not choose their story cards but they're free to accept any number of cards in each <em>Sprint Planning Turn</em> and they can return any number of cards at the <em>Mid Sprint Turn</em>.</p>
<h3>Scenario Card</h3>
<p>A scenario card represent a real situation in software development process. Some are good, more are bad. Each card may has good and bad effect to the <em>Burn down Point</em>.
